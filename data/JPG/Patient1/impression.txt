CASE 1 PNEUMONIAThe CXR shows a focal shadow in the right lower lobe with air bronchograms sug-gestive of pneumonia. It is clearly in the right lower lobe because the right hemidi-aphragm is eﬀaced. Right middle lobe shadows would eﬀace the right heart border.The presence of air bronchograms indicates pathology in the alveoli, as the con-ducting airways remain patent with air. Water or blood can also occupy the alveolias a result of pulmonary edema or pulmonary hemorrhage respectively. Thereshould be other supporting signs such as cardiomegaly, upper lobe diversion, andKerley B lines with pulmonary edema. The diﬀerential diagnoses of a focal shadowwith air bronchograms include bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma and lymphoma. Itis important to follow-up the CXR to ensure that total resolution of infectionoccurs. This may take up to three months in the elderly but generally someimprovement usually occurs within a week.
