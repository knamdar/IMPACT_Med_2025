CASE 2 LEFT PRIMARY SPONTANEOUS PNEUMOTHORAX
The CXR shows the visceral pleura (Fig. 2.2) separated from the parietal pleura by air which now occupies the potential space in the pleural cavity. The visceral pleura must not be mistaken for skin-fold shadows which usually occur in supine or obese patient CXR. In addition, the line from skin folds can be seen to cross the chest wall. In the patient above, the lungs appear otherwise healthy and this condition is called primary spontaneous pneumothorax. It occurs classically in young males. This is in contradistinction to secondary pneumothorax which occurs in diseased lungs, e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). Pneumothorax in an erect film is usually seen at the apex.
