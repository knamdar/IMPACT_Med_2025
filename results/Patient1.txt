The opacity in the right lower lung field is consistent with consolidation, which is a hallmark of pneumonia. The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and purulent sputum further support this diagnosis.

The heart size appears normal, and there is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

**Therefore, the impression is right lower lobe pneumonia.**
