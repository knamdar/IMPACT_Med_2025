**Impression:**
- **CXR:** The chest radiograph demonstrates a right lower lobe consolidation, concerning for pneumonia. The patient is intubated and receiving inotropes, suggesting severe illness.
- **CT:** The CT scan shows a liver lesion with a central hypodense area (arrow). This could represent a metastatic lesion, abscess, or other focal liver pathology.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- **CXR:** Pneumonia, aspiration.
- **CT:** Metastatic disease, abscess, focal liver necrosis.

**Recommendations:**

- Further investigation with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the liver is recommended to characterize the liver lesion.
- Consider infectious workup to identify the source of pneumonia.

**Disclaimer:** This impression is based solely on the provided images and limited clinical information. A complete evaluation requires correlation with the patient's history, physical exam, and other relevant investigations.
